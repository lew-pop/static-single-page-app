          <h3>Purpose of Data Processing</h3>
          <p class="pb-2 pb-sm-3 mb-3">
            The personal data collected is solely used for the purpose of responding to your
            inquiries about our notary services. This information is sent directly to the business
            email of the primary notary public officer responsible for managing and providing the
            requested services.
          </p>
          <h3>Data Sharing</h3>
          <p class="pb-2 pb-sm-3 mb-3">
            The personal data you provide through the contact form is sent using EmailJS, which
            facilitates email transmission without storing your data. We do not share your personal
            data with any other third parties.
